He expresses frustration with the verification process and the repetitive nature of the calls he receives.

He does not handle his own finances and has someone with power of attorney managing them. He is requesting that paperwork be sent directly to him, which he will then pass on to his financial representative. James is unable to provide bank statements or card details as these go directly to the person handling his finances. He expresses frustration with the verification process and the repetitive nature of the calls he receives. The client seems to have difficulty hearing the representative at times, mentioning that the call is breaking up.",
